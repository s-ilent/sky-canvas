The resolution of clouds should be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. 
512x512 is enough for many scenarios. 768x768 is good for most people, but the GPU load is very high. 1024x1024 is extreme. 
There's generally no need to change the Sky texture from the default unless you're targeting really low end hardware.
Same with Transmittance, although in practise it can be a precomputed texture with no real difference.
